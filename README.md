# List in Python:
  
  1)	It is a collection which is ordered and changeable.
  2)	It is used to store different data type values in it.
  3)	It stores values inside Square Brackets “ [ ]”
  4)	It looks like an array, but only diff is it stores diff values.
       
   
   Note: An array is collection of same data type values.

  Example:
                 L1  = [‘Varun’,’Dileep’,’Vijay’,’Naresh’, 1 , 2.0 , 3.43] 

        Index Position     0      1        2        3      4    5      6

Above list contains following data type values:

String: [‘Varun’,’Dileep’,’Vijay’,’Naresh’]
    Int : [1]
 Float: [2.0,3.43]

Note: you can add other data type values also like Boolean, decimal

“ A list may contain duplicate values with their distinct positions and hence, multiple distinct or duplicate values can be passed as a sequence at the time of list creation. “

Examples:
# Creating a List 
     List = [] 
     print("Intial blank List: ") 
     print(List) 
# Creating a List with  the use of Numbers 
# (Having duplicate values) 
       List = [1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 6, 5] 
       print("\nList with the use of Numbers: ")  
       print(List) 

# Creating a List with  mixed type of values 
# (Having numbers and strings) 
    List = [1, 2, 'Sachin', 4, 'Dhoni', 6, 'Kohli] 
    print("\nList with the use of Mixed Values: ") 
    print(List)
